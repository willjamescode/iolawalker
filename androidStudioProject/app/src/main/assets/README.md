# Neural Network Integration Instructions

## Model Files

To enable neural network inference for footfall detection, you need to place two files in this
`assets` directory:

1. `best_footfall_lstm.pth` - The PyTorch model for footfall detection
2. `lstm_scaler.pkl` - The data scaler for preprocessing accelerometer input

## Current Implementation

The current implementation uses a simplified peak detection algorithm as a placeholder.
To enable actual neural network inference:

1. Place the above-mentioned files in this directory
2. Uncomment the PyTorch integration code in `InferenceService.kt`

## MIDI Event Implementation

The code is designed to make it easy to add MIDI event output:

1. The `onFootfallDetected` callback in `InferenceService` is provided for this purpose
2. Precise timing information is included with each detection
3. You can implement MIDI output by providing a listener that connects to a MIDI device
